 ***************************************************************************
 
 * The following defines a trace header and file format.
 * All floating values in SPC files are in the IEEE standard formats.
 
 * There are two basic formats, new and old.  FVERSN flags the format and
 * also serves as a check byte. The new format has header values in the file
 * exactly as they appear below. The old format has slightly different file
 * header formating which is translated as it is read into memory. New features
 * like XY data and audit log information are not supported for the old format.
 
 * The new format allows X,Y pairs data to be stored when the TXVALS flag is set.
 * The main header is immediately followed by any array of fnpts 32-bit floating
 * numbers giving the X values for all points in the file or subfiles.  Note
 * that for multi files, there is normally a single X values array which applies
 * to all subfiles.  The X values are followed by a subfile header and fixed
 * point Y values array or, for multi files, by the subfiles which each consist
 * of a subfile header followed by a fixed-point Y values array.  Note that
 * the software may be somewhat slower when using X-values type files.
 
 * Another X,Y mode allows for separate X arrays and differing numbers of
 * points for each subfile.  This mode is normally used for Mass Spec Data.
 * If the TXYXYS flag is set along with TXVALS, then each subfile has a
 * separate X array which follows the subfile header and preceeds the Y array.
 * An additional subnpts subfile header entry gives the number of X,Y values
 * for the subfile (rather than the fnpts entry in the main header).  Under
 * this mode, there may be a directory subfile pointers whose offset is
 * stored in the fnpts main header entry.  This directory consists of an
 * array of ssfstc structures, one for each of the subfiles.  Each ssfstc
 * gives the byte file offset of the begining of the subfile (that is, of
 * its subfile header) and also gives the Z value (subtime) for the subfile
 * and is byte size.  This directory is normally saved at the end of the
 * file after the last subfile.    If the fnpts entry is zero, then no directory
 * is present and GRAMS/32 automatically creates one (by scanning through the
 * subfiles) when the file is opened.  Otherwise, fnpts should be the byte
 * offset into the file to the first ssfstc for the first subfile.  Note
 * that when the directory is present, the subfiles may not be sequentially
 * stored in the file.  This allows GRAMS/32 to add points to subfiles by
 * moving them to the end of the file.
 
 * Y values are represented as fixed-point signed fractions (which are similar
 * to integers except that the binary point is above the most significant bit
 * rather than below the least significant) scaled by a single exponent value.
 * For example, 0x40000000 represents 0.25 and 0xC0000000 represents -0.25 and
 * if the exponent is 2 then they represent 1 and -1 respectively.  Note that
 * in the old 0x4D format, the two words in a 4-byte DP Y value are reversed.
 * To convert the fixed Y values to floating point:
 *    FloatY = (2^Exponent)*FractionY
 * or:    FloatY = (2^Exponent)*IntegerY/(2^32)          -if 32-bit values
 * or:    FloatY = (2^Exponent)*IntegerY/(2^16)          -if 16-bit values
 
 * Optionally, the Y values on the disk may be 32-bit IEEE floating numbers.
 * In this case the fexp value (or subexp value for multifile subfiles)
 * must be set to 0x80 (-128 decimal).  Floating Y values are automatically
 * converted to the fixed format when read into memory and are somewhat slower.
 * GRAMS/32 never saves traces with floating Y values but can read them.
 
 * Thus an SPC trace file normally has these components in the following order:
 *      SPCHDR              Main header (512 bytes in new format, 224 or 256 in old)
 *      [X Values]          Optional FNPTS 32-bit floating X values if TXVALS flag
 *      SUBHDR              Subfile Header for 1st subfile (32 bytes)
 *      Y Values            FNPTS 32 or 16 bit fixed Y fractions scaled by exponent
 *      [SUBHDR]            Optional Subfile Header for 2nd subfile if TMULTI flag
 *      [Y Values]          Optional FNPTS Y values for 2nd subfile if TMULTI flag
 *      ...                 Additional subfiles if TMULTI flag (up to FNSUB total)
 *      [Log Info]          Optional LOGSTC and log data if flogoff is non-zero
 
 * However, files with the TXYXYS ftflgs flag set have these components:
 *      SPCHDR          Main header (512 bytes in new format)
 *      SUBHDR          Subfile Header for 1st subfile (32 bytes)
 *      X Values        FNPTS 32-bit floating X values
 *      Y Values        FNPTS 32 or 16 bit fixed Y fractions scaled by exponent
 *      [SUBHDR]        Subfile Header for 2nd subfile
 *      [X Values]      FNPTS 32-bit floating X values for 2nd subfile
 *      [Y Values]      FNPTS Y values for 2nd subfile
 *      ...             Additional subfiles (up to FNSUB total)
 *      [Directory]     Optional FNSUB SSFSTC entries pointed to by FNPTS
 *      [Log Info]      Optional LOGSTC and log data if flogoff is non-zero
 
 * Note that the fxtype, fytype, and fztype default axis labels can be
 * overridden with null-terminated strings at the end of fcmnt.    If the
 * TALABS bit is set in ftflgs (or Z=ZTEXTL in old format), then the labels
 * come from the fcatxt offset of the header.  The X, Y, and Z labels
 * must each be zero-byte terminated and must occure in the stated (X,Y,Z)
 * order.  If a label is only the terminating zero byte then the fxtype,
 * fytype, or fztype (or Arbitrary Z) type label is used instead.  The
 * labels may not exceed 20 characters each and all three must fit in 30 bytes.
 
 * The fpost, fprocs, flevel, fsampin, ffactor, and fmethod offsets specify
 * the desired post collect processing for the data.  Zero values are used
 * for unspecified values causing default settings to be used.  See GRAMSDDE.INC
 * Normally fpeakpt is zero to allow the centerburst to be automatically located.
 
 * If flogoff is non-zero, then it is the byte offset in the SPC file to a
 * block of memory reserved for logging changes and comments.  The beginning
 * of this block holds a logstc structure which gives the size of the
 * block and the offset to the log text.  The log text must be at the block's
 * end.    The log text consists of lines, each ending with a carriage return
 * and line feed.  After the final line's CR and LF must come a zero character
 * (which must be the first in the text).  Log text requires V1.10 or later.
 * The log is normally after the last subfile (or after the TXYXYS directory).
 
 * The fwplanes allows a series of subfiles to be interpreted as a volume of
 * data with ordinate Y values along three dimensions (X,Z,W).  Volume data is
 * also known as 4D data since plots can have X, Z, W, and Y axes.  When
 * fwplanes is non-zero, then groups of subfiles are interpreted as planes
 * along a W axis.  The fwplanes value gives the number of planes (groups of
 * subfiles) and must divide evenly into the total number of subfiles (fnsub).
 * If the fwinc is non-zero, then the W axis values are evenly spaced beginning
 * with subwlevel for the first subfile and incremented by fwinc after each
 * group of fwplanes subfiles.  If fwinc is zero, then the planes may have
 * non-evenly-spaced W axis values as given by the subwlevel for the first
 * subfile in the plane's group.  However, the W axis values must be ordered so
 * that the plane values always increase or decrease.  Also all subfiles in the
 * plane should have the same subwlevel.  Equally-spaced W planes are recommended
 * and some software may not handle fwinc=0.  The fwtype gives the W axis type.
